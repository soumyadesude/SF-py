 Python scripts to compute Structure Function. This code computes the structure function using the vectorization approach, as shown in https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02185. 


 All the relevant files are contained in the following directories: 

* ``./2d/`` - contains the scripts to compute second and third order structure functions for two-dimensional input data

* ``./3d/`` - contains the scripts to compute second and third order structure functions for three-dimensional input data

 

## Installing SF

``SF`` relies on a few prerequisites which are Python, h5py, Numba, Cupy [For gpu].
